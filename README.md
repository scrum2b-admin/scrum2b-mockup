==============

Dear Friends, Scrum2B Tool users and Agile/Scrum fans.

We are development the ideas for new screens of Scrum2B Tool version 2.0.
The main ideas are:
- Integrate all screen into one. Users could manage the Sprints and make plan in the same screen.
- Get easier to use in ScrumBoard
- Users could have many View modes and customize the modes.

The project is developed for new UX/UI codes for the screens.

You could see how it works at: http://new-mockup.scrum2b.com
If you find out any ideas to improve or fix bugs, please do not hesitate to send it to me.

Thanks and Best regards,

Scrumtobe Team
